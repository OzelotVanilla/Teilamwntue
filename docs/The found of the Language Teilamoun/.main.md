Te-TL does not like confusion. It want to use the vowels that the most people
can distinguish them from other vowels, as well as consonants.

If there is "or" in the pronunciation cell, please remember that:
the first one is the standard pronunciation,
however the others are also acceptable - since the pronunciation is similar.
