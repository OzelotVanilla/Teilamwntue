Te-TL does not like confusion. It want to use the vowels that the most people
can distinguish them from other vowels, as well as consonants.

If there is "or" in the pronunciation cell, please remember that:
the first one is the standard pronunciation,
however the others are also acceptable - since the pronunciation is similar.

Construction
=======================================

Construct a word
----------------

Word is the smallest meaningful part in Teilamwntue. To construct one word,
Teilamwntue uses "fragments" to build words. Most words can be seperated into many 
fragments, except words that are fragments themselves.

Fragments hold their own meaning, it is hard to find two fragments that have the same
meaning. Therefore, the words in Teilamwntue do not posesse two or more meaning normally.

Some fragments can be seen as adjective, and they can become one fragment of a word.


Build a sentence
----------------

<h3>- Functional part</h3>

The sentence is constructed of at least one part - **functional part**. 
Which is used to give the information to listeners.

For example (in English),

| Part or Sentence  | Fuctional or not | Why                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Go!               | Functional       | It is a command.                 |
| Yes!              | Functional       | Response to someone.             |
| No, the blue one. | Functional       | Add further detail.              |
| Here!             | Functional       | Raise attetion, want response.   |
| to                | Not Functional   | No real meaning in conversation. |

These examples show us that: to make our words **useful**, we need, or **must**,
let them have some functions. That is why the sentence is spoken functionally.
